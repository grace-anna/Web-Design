  </h1></center>
  <p>Nestled in the heart of Kerala, Cherthala is a hidden gem that boasts cultural richness and natural beauty. This guide will take you through the town's captivating landscapes, historical landmarks, and cultural experiences. </p>
  <h2>Etymology</h2>
  <p>
  <q>According to local legend, Vilwamangalam Swamiyar, the Kerala Hindu saint, while travelling through Cherthala, found an idol of the Devi with its head immersed in a muddy pond. The swami understood the divinity of the idol, took it out of the mud, cleaned it and consecrated it in a temple near the pond. Thus the place is believed to have gotten its name as cher meaning "mud" and thala meaning "head" in Malayalam. The deity of the temple has the name Cherthala Karthiyayani.</q></p>
