        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Mechanical engineering offers vast career opportunities across industries such as automotive, aerospace, energy, manufacturing, and robotics. Graduates can take up roles in design, production, maintenance, research & development, and quality control. With the rise of Industry 4.0, advancements in automation, AI-driven manufacturing, and sustainable engineering are creating new avenues for growth.
Public sector undertakings (PSUs) like BHEL, ONGC, and ISRO provide stable career options, while leading private firms such as Tata Motors, L&T, and Mahindra offer dynamic career progression.
Beyond traditional employment, mechanical engineers can venture into entrepreneurship by establishing startups in renewable energy, automation, 3D printing, and robotics. Government initiatives like Startup India and Atmanirbhar Bharat provide crucial funding and mentorship support.The four-year B.Tech program in Mechanical Engineering focuses on core engineering principles, design, and analysis. Students gain exposure to advanced topics such as robotics, automation, thermal sciences, and manufacturing processes.</p>
